<p>When you click on an order from the Order Manager screen you will be taken to another page which allows you to update the order. The screenshot below shows a sample order.Please update orders as soon as you can after receiving payment so that we can keep track of the money and available items.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="sample_order.png" style="width: 500;"></div>
<p>When someone pays you for an order, enter the amount of money that they paid to you and check the delivered box once they actually pick up the entire order. If you need to make some sort of comment, please do so in the provided comments box.</p>
<p>For example, if someone buys a koozie and a T-shirt and pays you before the T-shirt arrives, then you can enter their payment in the total paid box and make a comment that they have already picked up their koozie, but still need their shirt when it arrives. Wait to check the delivered box until the entire order has been delivered. Once an order has been marked delivered it will no longer be listed with the open orders.</p>
<p>Note that when you update an order, your name will be attached to the order so that if there are any questions we will know whom to contact.</p>
