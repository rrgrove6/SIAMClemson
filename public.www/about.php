<a href="http://www.siam.org/">SIAM</a> is the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The mission of SIAM is to build cooperation between mathematics and the worlds of science and technology through publications, research, and community. The Clemson University SIAM student chapter is organized by an officer crew elected each year by the students in the department. Leo Rebholz serves as the faculty advisor. To learn more, read our <a href="CU_SIAM_student_chapter_constitution_Revised.pdf">constitution</a>.</p>
<p>Each semester the SIAM student chapter hosts the departmental picnic. In addition, the chapter sells Clemson Math Department themed items throughout the year. Check out the <a href="archives.php">archives page</a> to see a little bit of the past, or browse the items currently for sale on the <a href="shopping/shop.php">shopping page</a>.</p>
