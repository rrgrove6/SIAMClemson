        <div class="abstract_content">
            <p>Accurate grain segmentation on 3D superalloy images is very important in materials science and engineering. From grain segmentation, we can derive the underlying superalloy grains micro-structures, based on which many important physical, mechanical and chemical properties of the superalloy samples can be evaluated. However, grain segmentation is usually a very challenging problem since: 1) even a small 3D superalloy sample may contain hundreds of grains; 2) carbides and noises may degrade the imaging quality; and 3) the intensity within a grain may not be homogeneous. In addition, a same grain may present different appearance, e.g., intensity, under different microscope settings. In practice, a 3D superalloy image may contain multichannel information where each channel corresponds to a specific microscope setting. In this paper, we develop a Multichannel Edge-Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (MCEWCVT) algorithm to effectively and robustly segment the superalloy grains from 3D multichannel superalloy images. MCEWCVT performs segmentation by minimizing an energy function which encodes both the multichannel voxel-intensity similarity within each cluster in the intensity domain and the smoothness of segmentation boundaries in the 3D image domain. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed MCEWCVT algorithm on a 4-channel Ni-based 3D superalloy image (consisting of 170 slices) against the manually annotated ground-truth segmentation. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons against 18 existing image segmentation algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MCEWCVT algorithm.</p>
